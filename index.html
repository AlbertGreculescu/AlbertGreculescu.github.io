        Hello!
        <br>
        I am Albert Greculescu, an 8th grade student at Accelerate Online Academy. I write a wide range of types of texts, like flash fiction, plays and persuasive essays, but one of the types of writing I enjoy most is writing science articles. The article shown here is how ages of stars can be measured. Why I decided to publish this article is because I am a young writer looking for a break into the publishing world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Science article:<br><br>
        Have you ever looked at a starry sky during the night? I think you did, but did you ever wonder why those stars stay there forever? Well, they don't. Stars have ages, and people can measure these ages.<br><br>
        How can they be measured?<br><br>
        Good question. There are several ways. All of these ways make measuring the ages of stars possible.<br><br>
        First, the mass of a star is a hint of how fast the said star will burn its fuel.<br><br>
        "A star like the Sun has enough fuel in its core to burn at its current brightness for approximately 9 billion years. The bigger the mass, the faster the star burns, and vice-versa. So if a globular cluster is more than 10 million years old, then all of its hydrogen-burning stars will be less massive than ten solar masses. Similarly, if a globular cluster is more than 2 billion years old, then there will be no hydrogen-burning stars more massive than two solar masses." As a result, no individual hydrogen-burning star will be more than 1,000 times brighter than the Sun.<br><br>
        "High mass stars are also much brighter than low mass stars; they rapidly burn through their supply of hydrogen fuel."<br><br>
        Second, globular clusters serve as cosmic clocks.<br><br>
        Each of the stars in a globular cluster that formed simultaneously can serve as cosmic clocks. If a globular cluster is more than 20 million years old, all of its hydrogen-burning stars will be less massive than ten solar masses. Thus, no individual hydrogen-burning star will be more than 1000 times brighter than the Sun. If a globular cluster is more than 2 billion years old, there will be no hydrogen-burning star more massive than two solar masses.<br><br>
        "One way astronomers estimate the age of the universe is by studying globular clusters. Globular clusters are a dense collection of roughly a million stars. Since all of the stars in a globular cluster formed at roughly the same time, they can serve as cosmic clocks."<br><br>
        Next, the older a star, the dimmer it is and the smaller the changes in its brightness.<br><br>
        "The oldest globular clusters contain only stars less massive than 0.7 solar masses. These low-mass stars are less bright than the Sun. This observation suggests that the oldest globular clusters are between 11 and 18 billion years old. The uncertainty in this estimate is due to the difficulty in determining the exact distance to a globular cluster. Another source of uncertainty in this estimate lies in our ignorance of some of the finer details of stellar evolution. Presumably, the universe itself is at least as old as the oldest globular clusters that reside in it."<br><br>
        "The changes in a star's brightness due to spots are tiny, typically a few percent or less, and become smaller the older the star. Therefore, people can't measure the rotation periods of stars older than about half a billion years from the ground where Earth's atmosphere interferes. Fortunately, this is not a problem for the Kepler spacecraft. Kepler was designed specifically to measure stellar brightnesses very precisely to detect planets."<br><br>
        Lastly, people can determine a cluster's age by plotting the colors and brightness of the stars in it.<br><br>
        "Learning a star's age is relatively easy when it's in a cluster of hundreds of stars that all formed at the same time."<br><br>
        "Astronomers have known for decades that if they plot the colors and brightnesses of the stars in a cluster, people can use the pattern they see to tell the cluster's age. But this technique only works on clusters. On the other hand, for stars not in clusters, determining the age is much more difficult."<br><br>
        "More massive main-sequence stars are also bluer (higher surface temperatures) than less massive stars. Thus, Sirius, which is more massive than the Sun, is blue and very luminous, whereas Alpha Centauri, which is less massive than the Sun, is red and less luminous."<br><br>
        "For a given chemical composition and stellar age, a star's luminosity, the total energy radiated by the star per unit time, depends only on its mass. Stars ten times more massive than the Sun are more than 1,000 times more luminous than the Sun. We should not be too embarrassed by the Sun's low luminosity: it is ten times brighter than a star of half its mass."<br><br>
        We can see that there are several ways people can measure the ages of stars, and each of them is as amazing as it sounds. Stars have a lifespan, like people, animals, and plants do.
